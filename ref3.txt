Many of the ideas in ex's visual mode (a.k.a. vi) were taken from other
software that existed at the time. According to Bill Joy, inspiration
for vi's visual mode came from the Bravo editor, which was a bimodal
editor. In an interview about vi's origins, Joy said, "A lot of the
ideas for the screen editing mode were stolen from a Bravo manual I
surreptitiously looked at and copied. Dot is really the double-escape
from Bravo, the redo command. Most of the stuff was stolen. There were
some things stolen from ed--we got a manual page for the Toronto version
of ed, which I think Rob Pike had something to do with. We took some of
the regular expression extensions out of that."

Joy used a Lear Siegler ADM3A terminal. On this terminal, the Escape key
was at the location now occupied by the Tab key on the widely used IBM
PC keyboard (on the left side of the alphabetic part of the keyboard,
one row above the middle row). This made it a convenient choice for
switching vi modes. Also, the keys h, j, k, l served double duty as
cursor movement keys and were inscribed with arrows, which is why vi
uses them in that way. The ADM3A had no other cursor keys. Joy explained
that the terse, single character commands and the ability to type ahead
of the display were a result of the slow 300 baud modem he used when
developing the software and that he wanted to be productive when the
screen was painting slower than he could think.
