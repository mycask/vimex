Joy was responsible for creating the first BSD Unix release in March,
1978, and included ex 1.1 (dated 1 February 1978) in the
distribution, thereby exposing his editor to an audience beyond UC
Berkeley. From that release of BSD Unix onwards, the only editors
that came with the Unix system were ed and ex. In a 1984 interview, Joy
attributed much of the success of vi to the fact that it was bundled for
free, whereas other editors, such as Emacs, could cost hundreds of
dollars.

Eventually it was observed that most ex users were spending all their
time in visual mode, and thus in ex 2.0, Joy created vi as a hard link
to ex, such that when invoked as vi, ex would automatically start up in
its visual mode. Thus, vi is not the evolution of ex, vi is ex.

Joy described ex 2.0 (vi) as a very large program, barely able to fit in
the memory of a PDP-11/70, thus although vi may be regarded as a small,
lightweight, program today, it was not seen that way early in its
history. By version 3.1, shipped with 3BSD in December 1979, the full
version of vi was no longer able to fit in the memory of a PDP-11.
